Wordle with medical terms

# Functionality

# Process

- find word list to use; some not medical; medications and bones too long; a lot of abbreviations. started with list from .removed numbers, appostrophes, names of people, and things that are less than four letters or longer than six. then removed prefixes, suffixes, obscur or latin terms and anything not medically related
- how to store word list?
- added keyboard; wanted to generate on load so no hard coded buttons but it was complicated by enter and delete button
- trying to add animation. can get it to work but it doesnt want to do all squares. it glitches and only moves one square.
- generalized message showing animation
